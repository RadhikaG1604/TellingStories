## Exploring My Journey in Telling Stories with Data

**Greetings 🙂 !**

I am thrilled to welcome you to my public portfolio, a dynamic showcase of my immersive experience in "Telling Stories with Data" course at CMU. Here, 
I've woven narratives through visualizations, turning raw data into compelling stories.

**Dive into Narratives**

This portfolio contains a curated collection of work done throughout the course, infused with the spirit of my coursework, guided by my professor, inspired and critiqued by peers.

If you're looking for someone who can transform data into compelling narratives, you've come to the right place.

- Identifying a visualization for enhancement, critiquing using a structured approach - data effectiveness profile, and redesigning the data representation using the techniques and tools learnt in class.

### 6. Final Project
- [Final Project Part I](https://radhikag1604.github.io/Telling_Stories_With_Data/final-project-part-one.html)
     Compiling required data, structured a narrative framework for the data story and generated initial conceptual sketches.
     
- [Final Project Part II](https://radhikag1604.github.io/Telling_Stories_With_Data/final-project-part-two.html)
     Using storyboard tools to develop the narrative by incorporating initial visualizations, user research and generating feedback for refinements.
      
- [Final Project Part III](https://radhikag1604.github.io/Telling_Stories_With_Data/final-project-part-three.html)
     Culminating the final polished narrative by reflecting on the gathered feedback and refining visuals.

<!-- ### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz) 
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
