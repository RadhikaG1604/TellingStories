# Welcome to my Portfolio!

## Exploring My Journey in Telling Stories with Data

**Greetings ðŸ™‚ !**

I am thrilled to welcome you to my public portfolio, a dynamic showcase of my immersive experience in "Telling Stories with Data" course at CMU. Here, 
I've woven narratives through visualizations, turning raw data into compelling stories.

**Dive into Narratives**

This portfolio contains a curated collection of work done throughout the course, infused with the spirit of my coursework, guided by my professor, inspired and critiqued by peers.

If you're looking for someone who can transform data into compelling narratives, you've come to the right place.

      - Final Project Part 1: Compiling required data, structured a narrative framework for the data story and generated initial conceptual sketches.
      
      - Final Project Part 2: Using storyboard tools to develop the narrative by incorporating initial visualizations, user research and generating 
                              feedback for refinements.
      
      - Final Project Part 3: Culminating the final polished narrative by reflecting on the gathered feedback and refining visuals. 

# About me

> Self-Driven, Quick Learner, Passionate Data Analyst with a curious mind trying to solve real-world challenges in healthcare.

Hailing from a small sub-urban town in India, I vividly remember witnessing the delivery of polio  immunization campaigns to address this huge disease. I was always intrigued by how it was able to target a billion people and how the disease was completely eradicated in 2010s. The quest to answer 
these questions led me tocome across two areas of science in my adolescence that piqued my interest - Healthcare and Information Technology. Since then, I have made careful choices in my academic pursuits and career to develop technical expertise in both these areas.                          

My undergraduate journey in biotechnology ignited my passion for applying scientific knowledge to real-world problems. For four years, I took on the role of a technical business analyst within the scientific & clinical informatics team of Zifo RnD Solutions. Here, I led a dedicated team of five or more analysts, spearheading the digital transformation projects for 4 out of the top 10 global biotech, biopharma, life science, and healthcare organizations spanning the USA, UK, and APAC regions. This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the challenges these industries faced and the expertise to adeptly address them, while meeting all client requirements. Currently, I'm on a path of further knowledge acquisition, pursuing a master's degree in healthcare analytics and IT at Carnegie Mellon University. My objective is to leverage this expertise to bridge the existing gaps in health IT and elevate patient outcomes. I am particularly enthusiastic about I am particularly enthusiastic about utilizing advanced data management and analysis techniques on healthcare data to drive innovation and enhance clinical decision-making by harnessing the potential of machine learning algorithms.

My background encompasses biotechnology, healthcare, data analytics and business analysis offering a diverse and multifaceted approach to tackling healthcare challenges. Collaboration is my forte, and I thrive in environments that promote open communication and creative problem-solving.

Scheduled to graduate in May 2024, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge, contributing to meaningful change within the healthcare industry. If you're searching for a passionate innovator dedicated to improving patient outcomes and reimagining healthcare, let's connect. Feel free to reach out to me via email at rgovind2@andrew.cmu.edu !

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. But in specific: 

- **Data Visualization Techniques:** Learn how to effectively visualize data using various tools and techniques such as charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards to make complex information more accessible and understandable
- **Story Telling FrameWorks:** Develop the ability to structure/craft and present compelling data-driven narratives using specific frameworks and methodologies for different audience groups depending on their level of technical expertise
- **Data Visualization Critique and Iteration:** Hone my ability to critically evaluate data visualizations, identifying strengths and weaknesses in the design and presentation of data. I also want to seek feedback and re-iterate the work to improve effectiveness
- **Visual Perception and Emotional Appeal:** Study the principles of visual perception to create data visualizations that are more intuitive and easier to understand. Also, to learn how to use emotional appeal in the data stories, to make it more relatable and memorable for the audience

# Portfolio

## Assignment 1: [Data_Visualization_1](https://radhikag1604.github.io/Telling_Stories_With_Data/Data_Visualization_1.html)
In this Data Visulazation Assignment, I have delved into the **OECD General Government Debt Data**, by utilizing various web-based visualization tools and the techniques I learnt in this course to create compelling data representations. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](https://radhikag1604.github.io/Telling_Stories_With_Data/critique-by-design.html)
In this exercise, I followed a structured process, beginning with selection of a visual to redesign, critiquing with data effectiveness profile, and refining through resketching and feedback. This transformed my perception of visualizations, fostering mutual learning and adaptation through diverse 
styles and techniques.

<!-- ### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz) 
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
