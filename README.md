# Hi I'm Radhika Govindarajan

*Self-Driven, Quick Learner, Passionate Data Analyst with a curious mind who loves to solve real-world challenges in the healthcare industry.*

Hailing from a small sub-urban town in India, I vividly remember witnessing the delivery of polio immunization campaigns to address this huge disease. I was always intrigued by how it was able to target a billion people and how the disease was completely eradicated in 2010s. The quest to answer these questions led me tocome across two areas of science in my adolescence that piqued my interest - Healthcare and Information Technology. Since then, I have made careful choices in my academic pursuits and career to develop technical expertise in both these areas.

My undergraduate journey in biotechnology ignited my passion for applying scientific knowledge to real-world problems. For four years, I took on the role of a technical business analyst within the scientific & clinical informatics team of Zifo RnD Solutions. Here, I led a dedicated team of five or more analysts, spearheading the digital transformation projects for 4 out of the top 10 global biotech, biopharma, life science, and healthcare organizations spanning the USA, UK, and APAC regions. This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the challenges these industries faced and the expertise to adeptly address them, while meeting all client requirements. Currently, I'm on a path of further knowledge acquisition, pursuing a master's degree in healthcare analytics and IT at Carnegie Mellon University. My objective is to leverage this expertise to bridge the existing gaps in health IT and elevate patient outcomes. I am particularly enthusiastic about I am particularly enthusiastic about utilizing advanced data management and analysis techniques on healthcare data to drive innovation and enhance clinical decision-making by harnessing the potential of machine learning algorithms.

My background encompasses biotechnology, healthcare, data analytics and business analysis offering a diverse and multifaceted approach to tackling healthcare challenges. Collaboration is my forte, and I thrive in environments that promote open communication and creative problem-solving.

Scheduled to graduate in May 2024, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge, contributing to meaningful change within the healthcare industry. If you're searching for a passionate innovator dedicated to improving patient outcomes and reimagining healthcare, let's connect. Feel free to reach out to me via email at rgovind2@andrew.cmu.edu !

# What I hope to learn

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
