# Wireframes / storyboards

In the process of wireframing my project, I deliberately opted for the 'Shorthand' tool due to its ability to create a compelling visual representation tailored to my target audience. Building upon the foundation laid in Part I and incorporating valuable feedback, I enriched the outline with intricate details, seamlessly integrating key callout statistics to shape a compelling narrative. I meticulously planned data visualizations for each section, reinforcing the overarching message I aimed to convey. To ensure my audience grasps the authentic essence of my final presentation, I chose to initially develop visualizations using Tableau and Flourish. This not only refined the visualizations but also brought greater clarity to the data story I sought to tell.

# User research 

## Target audience
The primary audience for my project comprises policy makers, including government officials and legislators, who hold key responsibilities in shaping healthcare policy and allocating funding. It is imperative that they grasp the data presented in order to make well-informed decisions regarding healthcare infrastructure of rural hospitals. In addition to policy makers, my project also aims to engage the broader public, particularly residents of rural areas. To effectively communicate the critical information, it is crucial to distill and elucidate the data, ensuring it is accessible and comprehensible to individuals who may not have a specialized background in healthcare policy or data analysis. This approach allows for a more inclusive and impactful dissemination of the findings, ultimately advocating for the preservation of vital healthcare resources in rural communities.

## Approach to finding representative individuals for interview


## Interview script
In devising my user research protocol, I gave paramount importance to three key elements: Aesthetics & Layout, Logical Coherence, and Persuasive Effectiveness. This approach significantly influenced the structure of my interview script, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. In addition to evaluating the overall flow of the narrative, I placed particular emphasis on obtaining specific feedback regarding the design and execution of each visualization. It was imperative that every visualization not only be clear and intuitive, but also seamlessly integrate with the surrounding context while effectively conveying the core message. To achieve this, I meticulously devised a set of targeted questions for discussion during the presentation walkthrough, as well as another set for assessing the overall presentation at its conclusion. Throughout the interview process, I iteratively refined certain aspects of the wireframe, incorporating valuable insights gained from each interaction.

I inquired about the following three aspects for each visualization:

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|      |                  |
|      |                  |
|      |                  |

Subsequent to the entire presentation, I also posed the following inquiries:

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|      |                  |
|      |                  |
|      |                  |
