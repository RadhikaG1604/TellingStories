# Wireframes / storyboards

In the process of wireframing my project, I deliberately opted for the 'Shorthand' tool due to its ability to create a compelling visual representation tailored to my target audience. Building upon the foundation laid in Part I and incorporating valuable feedback, I enriched the outline with intricate details, seamlessly integrating key callout statistics to shape a compelling narrative. I meticulously planned data visualizations for each section, reinforcing the overarching message I aimed to convey. To ensure my audience grasps the authentic essence of my final presentation, I chose to initially develop visualizations using Tableau and Flourish. This not only refined the visualizations but also brought greater clarity to the data story I sought to tell.

# User research 

## Target audience

The primary audience for my project comprises policy makers, including government officials and legislators, who hold key responsibilities in shaping healthcare policy and allocating funding. It is imperative that they grasp the data presented in order to make well-informed decisions regarding healthcare infrastructure of rural hospitals. In addition to policy makers, my project also aims to engage the broader public, particularly residents of rural areas. To effectively communicate the critical information, it is crucial to distill and elucidate the data, ensuring it is accessible and comprehensible to individuals who may not have a specialized background in healthcare policy or data analysis. This approach allows for a more inclusive and impactful dissemination of the findings, ultimately advocating for the preservation of vital healthcare resources in rural communities.

## Approach to finding representative individuals for interview

In order to gather a comprehensive perspective for my project, I employed a multifaceted approach in selecting interviewees. For the public policy aspect, I focused on engaging graduate students who were specializing in public policy, particularly those with a keen interest in healthcare. This group possessed a strong understanding of policy intricacies and offered invaluable insights into potential solutions and interventions. Additionally, I actively sought out individuals from the general public, specifically those residing in rural areas. Their firsthand experiences and unique viewpoints were crucial in comprehending the real-world impact of healthcare policies on local communities. This approach ensured that my findings resonated with a broad audience, fostering a more informed and inclusive dialogue surrounding rural healthcare infrastructure.

## Interview script

In devising my user research protocol, I gave paramount importance to following key elements: Overall Persuasive Effectiveness, Logical Coherence, Visual Design & Layout. This approach significantly influenced the structure of my interview script, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. In addition to evaluating the overall flow of the narrative, I placed particular emphasis on obtaining specific feedback regarding the design and execution of each visualization. It was imperative that every visualization not only be clear and intuitive, but also seamlessly integrate with the surrounding context while effectively conveying the core message. To achieve this, I meticulously devised a set of targeted questions for discussion during the presentation walkthrough, as well as another set for assessing the overall presentation at its conclusion. Throughout the interview process, I iteratively refined certain aspects of the wireframe, incorporating valuable insights gained from each interaction.

In terms of the interview structure, it was organized as follows:

**Question 1: First Impressions** What does this presentation seem to be about at first glance?
**Question 2: Storyline** Did the storyline flow smoothly throughout the presentation?
**Question 3: Clarity and Confusion** Was there anything that confused you?
**Question 4: Informative Sections** Which section of the presentation do you find the most informative?
**Question 5: Use of Color/Aesthetics** How do you feel about the use of color? Does it enhance or distract from the storytelling? 
**Question 6: Visualization Clarity and Website Layout**Do you find the visualizations clear and easy to understand along with the website layout?
**Question 6: Areas for Improvement** Do you have any additional feedback for improvement?

## Interview findings
Below are the findings from each of my interviewees:

- Interviewee 1 - 40 years male working in the Health Insurance sector

| Questions                       | Interviewee 1                       | Interviewee 2                    | Interviewee 3                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|  1. What does this presentation seem to be about at the first glance ? | Highlights risks faced by rural hospitals | Points out an underlying problem with rural hospitals | Talks about issue of rural hospitals shutting down | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| 2. Does the story line smoothly run throughout/ How is the logical coherence in the story | Overall structure and coherence is present. However, suggested that the story can begin with an impact such as a personal story of someone affected by the issue, before delving into the key subject matter |   Appreciated the current structure, which begins with an overview, demographics, addresses the issue, and concludes with its impact. | Recommends refining the focus of the presentation. Instead of oscillating between urban and rural, suggested to concentrate on one aspect. For instance, begin with a  clear urban-rural comparison  and then delve into the issues  and causes specific to rural areas |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  3.Which section of the presentation do you find the most informative? | Found the "Key issue" section most informative. Specifically, appreciated        insights into trends in closure. | Also found the "Key issue" section the most informative in the issue, and the state-wise spread of the issue.| Expressed suprise at the depth of the causes section and at learning that private insurers play a significant role in the issue provided. |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 4. Was there anything confusing/distracting ? | The bar graph comparing urban and rural population was undermining the issue. Can be represented in some other form. Line chart does not show an increase - Can be highlighted. The second most populous state - Takes time to think - Can be called out. Suggested that the term marginal can be replaced with simpler - non technical term may be "Profits". Impact section - Try to elaborate and stick to single context |  The story is very clear. Personally felt that the scroll mode which zooms in and zooms out is a little distracting, so the scroll section can be reduced |  Re-iterated the shift in focus from rural to urban hospitals while comparing, focuses on rural, then again goes back to comparison in causes section. It is better to find a way to concentrate or highlight only rural to remained focused on story line |           
|-----|-----|-----|
| 5. How do you feel about the use of  color? Does it enhance the story telling ?  | Suggested that a different color other than green can be used as it is generally associated with highlighting or pointing out positive findings. Otherwise felt that the color palette was neat and went along with website template and pitcures | Appreciated the consistency in color palette throughout for 3 hospital types, especially said the chloreopath was looking professional | Suggested highlighting only rural hospital metrics throughout and leave everything else in grey in all This would enhance the focus on rural hospitals. |         
|-----|-----|-----|
| 6. Do you find the visualizations clear  and easy to understand along with the website layout? | Last visual on the payers and hospital types can be grouped based on hospitals to make it easily comprehendable. Need to ensure consistent sizing of text in visuals. | Felt that the visuals were self explanatory. However, commented that Margin Trends graph needs little attention to grasp the numbers. Mentioned that just when scrolling through the website, based on the title of the graphs, able to grasp the storyline. | Easy and simpler graphs. Suggested numbers can be included in plots to make it readable along with the other elements |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 7. Do you have any overall feedback for improvement ? | Mentioned that overall layout was good, however mentioned that the above suggested changes have to be made | Good and clear story overall, layout can be modified a bit to ensure distracting elements | Interesting insights. Suggested changes to visuals and 
text have to be made.|
