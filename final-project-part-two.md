# Wireframes / storyboards

In the process of wireframing my project, I deliberately opted for the 'Shorthand' tool due to its ability to create a compelling visual representation tailored to my target audience. Building upon the foundation laid in Part I and incorporating valuable feedback, I enriched the outline with intricate details, seamlessly integrating key callout statistics to shape a compelling narrative. I meticulously planned data visualizations for each section, reinforcing the overarching message I aimed to convey. To ensure my audience grasps the authentic essence of my final presentation, I chose to initially develop visualizations using Tableau and Flourish. This not only refined the visualizations but also brought greater clarity to the data story I sought to tell.

# User research 

## Target audience

The primary audience for my project comprises policy makers, including government officials and legislators, who hold key responsibilities in shaping healthcare policy and allocating funding. It is imperative that they grasp the data presented in order to make well-informed decisions regarding healthcare infrastructure of rural hospitals. In addition to policy makers, my project also aims to engage the broader public, particularly residents of rural areas. To effectively communicate the critical information, it is crucial to distill and elucidate the data, ensuring it is accessible and comprehensible to individuals who may not have a specialized background in healthcare policy or data analysis. This approach allows for a more inclusive and impactful dissemination of the findings, ultimately advocating for the preservation of vital healthcare resources in rural communities.

## Approach to finding representative individuals for interview

In order to gather a comprehensive perspective for my project, I employed a multifaceted approach in selecting interviewees. For the public policy aspect, I focused on engaging graduate students who were specializing in public policy, particularly those with a keen interest in healthcare. This group possessed a strong understanding of policy intricacies and offered invaluable insights into potential solutions and interventions. Additionally, I actively sought out individuals from the general public, specifically those residing in rural areas. Their firsthand experiences and unique viewpoints were crucial in comprehending the real-world impact of healthcare policies on local communities. This approach ensured that my findings resonated with a broad audience, fostering a more informed and inclusive dialogue surrounding rural healthcare infrastructure.

## Interview script

In devising my user research protocol, I gave paramount importance to following key elements: Overall Persuasive Effectiveness, Logical Coherence, Visual Design & Layout. This approach significantly influenced the structure of my interview script, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. In addition to evaluating the overall flow of the narrative, I placed particular emphasis on obtaining specific feedback regarding the design and execution of each visualization. It was imperative that every visualization not only be clear and intuitive, but also seamlessly integrate with the surrounding context while effectively conveying the core message. To achieve this, I meticulously devised a set of targeted questions for discussion during the presentation walkthrough, as well as another set for assessing the overall presentation at its conclusion. Throughout the interview process, I iteratively refined certain aspects of the wireframe, incorporating valuable insights gained from each interaction.

In terms of the interview structure, it was organized as follows:

**Question 1: First Impressions** What does this presentation seem to be about at first glance?
**Question 2: Storyline** Did the storyline flow smoothly throughout the presentation?
**Question 3: Clarity and Confusion** Was there anything that confused you?
**Question 4: Informative Sections** Which section of the presentation do you find the most informative?
**Question 5: Insights and Knowledge** Do you feel like you gained new insights or knowledge from this website?
**Question 6: Use of Color/Aesthetics** How do you feel about the use of color? Does it enhance or distract from the storytelling?
**Question 7: Visualization Clarity** Do you find the visualizations clear and easy to understand?
**Question 8: Logical Coherence** Were you able to connect different sections through the visualizations?
**Question 9: Website Layout/Structure** What do you think of the website's layout and overall structure?
**Question 10: Areas for Improvement** Do you have any additional feedback for improvement?
