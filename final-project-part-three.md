# The final data story
You can access my final data story addressing the critical issue of **"Rural Hospitals on the Verge of Closure"** [here]! 

# Reflections on my Final Project

## The audience
The audience for my final data story primarily included two key groups: policy makers, who wield significant influence over healthcare policies and funding allocation, and residents of rural areas who directly experience the impact of rural hospital closures. This identification was shaped by valuable insights garnered from research. To cater to this diverse audience, specific adjustments were made in the final project. I incorporated a more personal touch by sharing narratives and quotes from individuals residing in rural areas. This humanized approach aims to resonate with both policy makers, who need a clear understanding of the issue's real-world impact, and rural residents, who seek a voice in advocating for their community's healthcare resources. Additionally, I ensured that the data visualizations were intuitive and accessible, as some of my audience may not have specialized backgrounds in healthcare policy or data analysis. I strategically emphasized the collective responsibility we all share in safeguarding the accessibility of healthcare services in rural communities and integrated a call for action to inspire tangible steps towards addressing the pressing issue of rural hospital closures.

### Part I
Part 1 of my project was a valuable exercise that enabled me to put together a comprehensive and well-structured plan for the story on rural hospitals. It 
allowed me to dive into the issue with an acute attention to detail, meticulously analyzing the available data. It became evident that to truly convey the bigger context of the story, I needed substantial supporting data. Not only was I dissecting the issue, but I was also considering how to effectively convey and persuade the audience through the issue and its impact. When I began crafting the initial sketches, it marked a turning point in how I thought about visually representing the data. This hands-on process drove home the importance of clear and compelling visuals in conveying complex information. Part 1 was instrumental in not only dissecting the issue at hand but also in shaping how I communicate it.

### Part II
The activities undertaken in Part 2 was instrumental in advancing the groundwork established in Part 1. Notably, storyboarding proved to be so helpful, aiding in the meticulous planning of data visualizations and the integration of key statistics to seamlessly structure the narrative. Additionally, user research was a linchpin of Part 2, affording me a deeper understanding of my audience. It became apparent that primary stakeholders, including policy makers and rural residents, necessitated tailored approaches to ensure a wider dissemination of findings.

Moreover, the interview process, which engaged a diverse range of participants, further solidified the project's trajectory. Insights gained from these interviews acted as a guiding force for refining the wireframe. Each interviewee's unique perspective provided a valuable lens through which to assess and enhance the wireframe, resulting in a more polished and impactful presentation. These refinements directly addressed user feedback, ensuring the final narrative is not only comprehensive but also engaging and actionable.

# Changes made since Part II
 
Since completing Part II, I have taken into account the invaluable feedback received from the interviewees, which has greatly influenced the evolution of the project. Below are some of the key takeaways from Part II that enabled me to build a more holistic and aesthetically appealing story in Shorthand as the final deliverable:

**Maintaining a Sharp Focus on Rural Hospitals**
A pivotal alteration I implemented concerned the coherence and focus of the narrative. Rather than toggling between urban and rural comparisons, I chose to highlight the specific challenges faced by rural hospitals. This adjustment was purposeful and intended to craft a narrative that flows seamlessly, presenting a lucid and engaging depiction of the situation. This was achieved by consistently emphasizing rural hospitals, deliberately bringing them to the forefront, while diminishing the prominence of other elements. Through this approach, my aim was to guide the audience's attention towards these vital rural healthcare centers throughout the entirety of the narration.

**Refinements to Visuals**
- The bar graph illustrating the comparison between urban and rural populations underwent a transformation to pie chart to more effectively highlight the difference in population.
- In regards to the line chart depicting the trends in hospital closures, the upward trend in the middle section initially caused confusion for viewers. After receiving consistent feedback from the interviewees, I made the decision to incorporate specific highlights on the trend to provide a clear explanation for the increase observed in the year 2020. This adjustment was implemented to address any potential sources of misunderstanding and ensure that the graph is easily interpretable at first glance.
- The graph illustrating profit margins across different payer types and hospital categories initially organized bars by hospital type. However, feedback highlighted that rearranging the grouping in reverse would more effectively demonstrate the substantial impact of private payers on hospitals facing financial losses. Consequently, I reconfigured the graph to prioritize rural hospitals, while incorporating a transitional graph. This additional element pinpointed the axis range specific to private payers, providing a clear visual distinction between rural hospitals and other healthcare facilities in terms of payments received. This adjustment aimed to enhance the visual narrative, emphasizing the critical role of private payers in financial outcomes for different hospital types.

**Refining colors and other attributes of visuals**
- A key piece of feedback I received highlighted the effectiveness of a consistent color palette. However, some interviewees pointed out that the use of green, typically associated with positive outcomes, might not be suitable for highlighting the crisis faced by rural hospitals. In response, I opted for a subdued "sandal" color, in contrast to a palette of grey and various shades of brown, for the map visual. This adjustment was made to ensure that the visual representation accurately conveyed the severity of the situation for rural hospitals.
- To uphold uniformity, I made certain to employ identical fonts and font sizes for elements such as titles, subtitles, axis labels, tick marks, visual labels, and margin spaces across all graphs featured in the storyboard. This meticulous approach was taken to guarantee a cohesive visual experience throughout the presentation.
- Moreover, I integrated recommendations to incorporate numerical values in plots and annotations to enhance overall readability. This adjustment ensures that the data is not only presented visually but also quantitatively accessible to the audience.
  
**Layout**
Regarding the website layout, I took care to uphold a uniform color scheme of black, white, and textured sand throughout the layout. The supporting images I incorporated were carefully chosen to either contrast or harmonize with the overall design. Further, I made specific adjustments to the scroll mode to minimize distractions when zooming in and out. This was to ensure a seamless and user-friendly browsing experience, and also enhance focus on required content, allowing the audience to easily navigate and also absorb the content in an effective manner.

**Story Persuasion**
Acknowledging the significance of a compelling personal narrative to underscore the real-life consequences of rural hospital closures, I incorporated direct quotes from individuals in rural areas, providing a firsthand account of their concerns from several news articles. This adjustment injected a more human element into the narrative, effectively accentuating the pressing nature of the issue.

In essence, the revisions implemented since Part II as mentioned above were rooted in a dedication to enhance the narrative's impact. By attentively considering the insights provided by the interviewees, I refined the project to strike a more profound chord with the audience. The result is a narrative that not only covers the breadth of the issue but also captivates and encourages actionable responses.
