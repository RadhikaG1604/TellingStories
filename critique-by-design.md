# Assignment 4: Critique & Design

## Step one: Finding a Data Visualization

Given my profound dedication to healthcare, I was keen on selecting a data visualization that holds significant sway in comprehending and combatting healthcare challenges. In my research, I encountered the National Governor Association's Report on COVID-19 Statewise Outbreak Summary Statistics. Within this comprehensive report, the Kansas Cluster Summary Dashboard stood out to me. This particular visualization stands as a beacon of critical insights, shedding light on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics across diverse healthcare settings. It serves as a significant story for making well-informed decisions and executing targeted interventions.

Yet, what truly spurred my interest in this visualization was its evident shortfall in effectively conveying pivotal data. This realization highlighted the untapped potential that, if harnessed, could yield a substantial impact in healthcare strategy and response efforts.

## Step Two: Critique the Data Visualization

As the next in redesigning the visualization, I wanted to identify the strength and weaknesses in the current form of visualization. I utilized Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectivess Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) method to critique the visual on several intricate aspects.

As can be seen above, the Kansas cluster summary dashboard consists of a table presenting diverse outbreak settings, detailing the instances within each setting, alongside case counts, and counts of hospitalizations and deaths. However, it can be observed that headers for "All Clusters" and "Active Clusters" are included, but without clarification on the criteria for active clusters. The data regarding cluster occurrences per setting is depicted in one pie chart, while the corresponding COVID-19 case counts per setting are shown in another. Both charts feature separate legends, utilizing a multitude of colors.

Upon a comprehensive assessment based on seven aspects of data visualization effectiveness, several critical observations emerged. In terms of usefulness i.e., if it is useful for the intended audience and if communicates valuable information, the visualization does contain the intended data, crucial for identifying COVID-19 hotspots and guiding precautionary measures. However, the inclusion of extraneous information on active clusters, deaths, and hospitalizations proves distracting, as interpretation proves challenging.

Regarding completeness, while the visualization offers essential information, the additional attributes of deaths and hospitalizations introduce potential distortions to the overall impact. This leads to potential dilution of the core message. Perceptibility emerges as a significant concern, with the multiple pie charts failing to clearly represent the variations between outbreak options or provide clear quantitative significance. Moreover, the separation of COVID-19 case numbers into a distinct pie chart complicates direct comparison and necessitates additional cognitive effort.

Truthfulness is also an area of consideration, as the pie chart representation deviates from an accurate depiction, with the segments failing to cumulatively total to 100%. Given the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 in 2020, the data may not offer pinpoint precision, particularly concerning hospitalizations and fatalities. The basic representation form, a pie chart, is familiar, yet in this context, it proves challenging to discern proportions and differences between categories.

Furthermore, the cluster sizes may hold less significance compared to case numbers, as a substantial correlation between the two is absent. Specific guidance on which hotspots to avoid is not effectively communicated, necessitating deeper audience analysis. From an aesthetic perspective, the visual layout is less appealing, with data scattered across multiple components, including tables and pie charts. Additionally, the pie charts lack gradients to convey variations in outbreak spots, instead employing a dominant rainbow color scheme that demands heightened audience attention.

In summary, while the Kansas cluster summary dashboard provides critical data, its effectiveness is hindered by challenges in completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, and aesthetics. These elements should be carefully addressed to enhance the visualization's impact and clarity.

Below is my rating for each of the seven individual aspects in the effectiveness profile:
