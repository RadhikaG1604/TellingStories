# Assignment 4: Critique & Design

## Step one: Finding a Data Visualization

Given my profound dedication to healthcare, I was keen on selecting a data visualization that holds significant sway in comprehending and combatting healthcare challenges. In my research, I encountered the National Governor Association's Report on COVID-19 Statewise Outbreak Summary Statistics. Within this comprehensive report, the Kansas Cluster Summary Dashboard stood out to me. This particular visualization stands as a beacon of critical insights, shedding light on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics across diverse healthcare settings. It serves as a significant story for making well-informed decisions and executing targeted interventions.

Yet, what truly spurred my interest in this visualization was its evident shortfall in effectively conveying pivotal data. This realization highlighted the untapped potential that, if harnessed, could yield a substantial impact in healthcare strategy and response efforts.
