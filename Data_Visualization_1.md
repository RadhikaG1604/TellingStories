# Visualizing Government Debt

## 1. Embedding General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Chart 

The following chart was created using the OECD's visualization tool, which allowed me to directly interact with their general government debt data. By filtering for the year 2022, I focused on visualizing the corresponding dataset. My aim was to spotlight the top 5 countries with the highest debt-to-GDP ratios, since it generally indicates that a country may have difficulty in paying back its debt and may have implications for its fiscal stability and economic health. To emphasize that countries with lower government debt-to-GDP ratios are managing well, I chose to depict them in grey.
