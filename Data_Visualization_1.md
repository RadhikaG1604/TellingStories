# Visualizing Government Debt

## 1. Embedding General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Chart

The following chart was created using the OECD's visualization tool, which allowed me to directly interact with their general government debt data. By filtering for the year 2022, I focused on visualizing the corresponding dataset. My aim was to spotlight the top 5 countries with the highest debt-to-GDP ratios, since it generally indicates that a country may have difficulty in paying back its debt and may have implications for its fiscal stability and economic health. To emphasize that countries with lower government debt-to-GDP ratios are managing well, I chose to depict them in grey.

## 2. Part 2: Utilizing Flourish to Visualize General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio

The following graphic was produced utilizing "Flourish," a platform dedicated to data visualization. I employed various essential functionalities within the tool to illustrate the trends in Debt-to-GDP ratios across multiple OECD countries spanning from 1995 to 2022. The sparklines greatly facilitate the smooth comparison of data points. The Flourish interface provided me the capability to import the data directly from an Excel file. Additionally, it afforded me the ability to handle the data through a range of customization features, including axis configurations, color assignments, annotations and text formatting options, all of which contributed to enhancing the visual appeal and clarity of the visual representation below. I chose a 

The provided visualization comprises a grid of line charts, illustrating the Debt-to-GDP Ratio of several OECD countries spanning from 1995 to 2022. The title "Post Pandemic Resilience" aptly reflects the focus on how these nations managed their fiscal indicators following the global health crisis. The Debt-to-GDP Ratio, expressed as a percentage, serves as a critical measure of a country's economic health. A higher ratio implies a significant portion of a nation's revenue is allocated towards debt repayment, signaling potential fiscal challenges. Conversely, a lower ratio indicates a healthier fiscal standing.

In the pre-pandemic period (1995-2019), each country exhibited distinct trends in their Debt-to-GDP ratios, which could be influenced by a range of factors including policy decisions, economic cycles, and various strategic choices. However, a noticeable and uniform surge in the ratio is observed in the year 2020 across all countries, directly attributed to the pandemic and its ensuing economic impact, including lockdowns and diminished revenue streams. The most noteworthy observation emerges from the data for the years 2021 and 2022 indicated by the end dot in the sparkline. Post-pandemic, there is a discernible shift in the Debt-to-GDP Ratios of these nations. This shift indicates either a declining trend or a stabilization, signifying a notable rebound from the pandemic's impact. This resilience can be attributed to a combination of factors including economic recovery following the relaxation of lockdown measures, and structural reforms undertaken by several countries, encompassing tax policies, public spending, and other fiscal strategies.
