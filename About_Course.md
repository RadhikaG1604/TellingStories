# About the Course

## My understanding of the course

In a world inundated with data, the ability to extract meaningful insights and convey them effectively is a game-changer. In my understanding the course "Telling Stories with Data" at CMU, tends to dive deep into established techniques for data visualization, while also exploring the latest trends in the field.

From dissecting renowned data visualizations to creating our own, this course promises me a hands-on experience. It's not just theory - it's about getting our hands dirty with real data and learning to present it in ways that resonate with our audience.By the end of this course, I anticipate not just a new set of skills, but a whole new way of thinking about data and communication. 

## Precourse Reflection: What I hope to learn

All the things - obviously. But in specific: 

- **Data Visualization Techniques:** Learn how to effectively visualize data using various tools and techniques such as charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards to make complex information more accessible and understandable
- **Story Telling FrameWorks:** Develop the ability to structure/craft and present compelling data-driven narratives using specific frameworks and methodologies for different audience groups depending on their level of technical expertise
- **Data Visualization Critique and Iteration:** Hone my ability to critically evaluate data visualizations, identifying strengths and weaknesses in the design and presentation of data. I also want to seek feedback and re-iterate the work to improve effectiveness
- **Visual Perception and Emotional Appeal:** Study the principles of visual perception to create data visualizations that are more intuitive and easier to understand. Also, to learn how to use emotional appeal in the data stories, to make it more relatable and memorable for the audience

## Postcourse Reflection: What I actually learnt

- My entire outlook on data visualizations underwent a profound transformation through this course. One of the pivotal aspects of this course was the introduction of visualization and storyboarding tools like Fluorish, Tableau and Shorthand. This hands-on experience allowed me to explore a broader spectrum of options and expand my repertoire of visualization techniques.
- What stood out to me was the deliberate progression in learning. We began with fundamental exercises, focusing on colors. As we delved deeper, we ventured into chart types, a foundational element in visualization design. What truly set this course apart was the emphasis on critique. By evaluating both our own work and that of our peers, we gained invaluable insights. It wasn't just about identifying flaws, but about discerning opportunities for improvement. This process, at times challenging, significantly contributed to our collective learning.
- Towards the end of the course, there was an amalgamation of all these elements. This holistic approach allowed us to apply our knowledge in a practical context.Learning how to weave a compelling narrative through visual elements was an eye-opener.

Overall, the course structure addressed each topic methodically facilitating a comprehensive understanding and not only honed my technical skills but also cultivated a more discerning eye for effective data communication.
