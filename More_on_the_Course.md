# Quick Intro on my course




# Precourse Reflection: What I hope to learn

All the things - obviously. But in specific: 

- **Data Visualization Techniques:** Learn how to effectively visualize data using various tools and techniques such as charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards to make complex information more accessible and understandable
- **Story Telling FrameWorks:** Develop the ability to structure/craft and present compelling data-driven narratives using specific frameworks and methodologies for different audience groups depending on their level of technical expertise
- **Data Visualization Critique and Iteration:** Hone my ability to critically evaluate data visualizations, identifying strengths and weaknesses in the design and presentation of data. I also want to seek feedback and re-iterate the work to improve effectiveness
- **Visual Perception and Emotional Appeal:** Study the principles of visual perception to create data visualizations that are more intuitive and easier to understand. Also, to learn how to use emotional appeal in the data stories, to make it more relatable and memorable for the audience
